# Archived Examples (Legacy v1.x API)

These examples were written for the original FACETpy v1.x API based on the
`facet.facet` class and its framework-based architecture (`AnalysisFramework`,
`CorrectionFramework`, `EvaluationFramework`).

**They will not run with FACETpy v2.0+.**

The legacy API has been replaced by the modular processor/pipeline architecture.
See `examples/complete_pipeline_example.py` for the current recommended approach.

These files are kept for historical reference only.
