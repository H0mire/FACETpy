"""
Memory-efficient pipeline using channel-sequential execution.

``pipeline.run(channel_sequential=True)`` groups consecutive processors that
declare ``channel_wise = True`` (or ``run_once = True``) into a single
per-channel pass.  For each channel the full sequence executes before moving
to the next::

    ch 1 → HighPassFilter → UpSample → TriggerAligner → AAS → DownSample → store
    ch 2 → HighPassFilter → UpSample → (skip aligner) → AAS → DownSample → store
    …

Because TriggerAligner has ``run_once = True`` it executes only for the first
channel (updating trigger metadata) and is silently skipped for the rest.

The output array is pre-allocated at the final sfreq so the 10× upsampled
data never exists for all channels simultaneously.

Concepts used
-------------
channel_wise = True  Processor can run on a single-channel context.
run_once     = True  In channel_sequential mode: run for the first channel
                     only, skip for subsequent channels.

These flags have no relation to multiprocessing.
