# FACETpy Documentation Status

**Date:** 2025-10-13  
**Status:** 🚧 In Progress

## Summary

Sphinx documentation for FACETpy v2.0 has not been built yet. This note collects the outstanding tasks needed before we can report on documentation quality or coverage.

## Next Steps

- Audit existing `.rst` pages for accuracy and remove speculative sections.
- Ensure `docs/requirements.txt` installs cleanly inside a fresh environment.
- Run `sphinx-build` locally and capture actual build results, including any warnings.
- Populate missing guides only after confirming the underlying features exist.

## Open Questions

- Which processors and workflows are ready for fully documented examples?
- How should we structure API references if modules continue to shift?
- Do we want to target Read the Docs deployment, or keep builds local until verified?
