# FACETpy Testing Status

**Date:** 2025-01-12  
**Status:** 🚧 In Progress

## Summary

Automated testing for FACETpy v2.0 has not been executed yet. This document tracks the outstanding work required before any performance or coverage claims can be made.

## Next Steps

- Implement baseline unit and integration tests across the core, I/O, preprocessing, correction, and evaluation modules.
- Create reliable fixtures for sample EEG data, triggers, and processing contexts.
- Run the suite locally to establish initial coverage numbers.
- Document real execution results and regressions once collected.

## Planned Areas of Focus

- Validate pipeline execution paths and context handling.
- Exercise artifact correction processors with synthetic data.
- Verify evaluation metrics for consistency against known inputs.
- Measure runtime characteristics only after functional correctness is confirmed.
