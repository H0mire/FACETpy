# FACETpy Refactoring Status

**Date:** 2025-01-12  
**Status:** Planning

The refactoring work outlined for FACETpy v2.0 has not been executed yet. Use this space to track actual implementation progress once development begins.

## Initial TODOs

- Define the target module boundaries and processor abstractions.
- Decide how pipelines should orchestrate processors and manage metadata.
- Prototype a minimal end-to-end flow before expanding the catalog.
- Document real milestones only after the code lands and is exercised.
