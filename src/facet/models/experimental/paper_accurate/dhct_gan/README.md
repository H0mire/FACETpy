# DHCT-GAN — experimental paper_accurate variant

Dual-branch convolution and attention model. This experimental variant adds separate fusion gates, least-squares adversarial losses and discriminator feature matching. Its shared encoder and reduced EEG configuration remain FACETpy adaptations.

## Origin and role

Origin: EEG artifact removal.
